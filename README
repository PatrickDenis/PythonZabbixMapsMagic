This script is still a work in progress, I use it to automatically make maps for all hosts in a host group.
It links all hosts to a dummy image element so that the links, linktriggers and labels are already added, you only have to rearrange them manually.
I have labels on all links with 5 minute avg latency and 5 min avg packetloss


Getting started:
set the variables at the beginning of the script
customize the label expression you want to see on your links
label = "{" + hostname + ":icmppingsec.avg(5m)}\r\n{" + hostname + ":icmppingloss.avg(5m)}"
change the dummyelement to your liking:
dummy_element = {"selementid": "1",
                                      "elements": [],
                                      "elementtype": "4",
                                      "iconid_off": "2",
                                      "x": 500,
                                      "y": 500,
                                      'label': 'Remove this after all links are corrected',
                                      'label_location': '-1'
                                     }

TODO:
Set images automatically if host is member of some other hostgroup
Ask user to input which node is the central node and link everything to that one
Rewrite the script so all the data is gathered at the beginning of the script and then reused locally, instead of doing a shitton of api calls :D
Feel free to help me make this list grow, I think the community could use more of this :)
